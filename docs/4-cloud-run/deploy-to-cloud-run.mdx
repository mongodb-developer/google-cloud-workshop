# Deploy to Cloud Run

Yo’re finally ready to deploy the application! You can do this from the Cloud Shell Editor.

1. Select the **Cloud Code** extension on the left sidebar.

    <img
        alt="Left-hand menu in Cloud Shell highlighting the Cloud Code extension button"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/cloud-code-extension.png')}
        width="300"
    />

1. Expand the **Cloud Run** section.

    <img
        alt="Cloud Code extention expanded with the Cloud Run section highlighted"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/cloud-run-section.png')}
        width="300"
    />

1. Click the Deploy to Cloud Run icon.

    <img
        alt="Deploy to Cloud Run button in the Cloud Run extension"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/deploy-to-cloud-run.png')}
        width="500"
    />

1. Enter the following configuration settings for your service:

    - Service Settings: **Create a service**
    - Service name: **bakery-web-app**
    - Deployment platform: **Cloud Run (fully managed)**
    - Region: **closest to your physical location**
    - Authentication: **Allow unauthenticated invocations**

    For the Build environment, select **Local Build**.

    Finally, in the Build Settings section, select:

    - Builder: **Docker**
    - Docker: **Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop/Dockerfile**

1. Click the **Deploy** button and wait as your app is being deployed to the cloud! This can take a few minutes. You can expand the process output by clicking on the **Show Detailed Logs** button.

1. When the deployment is complete, you will see the URL for your application. Click it and you will see the bakery application displaying a list of the cakes in your Atlas database.

    <img
        alt="Deployment output in Cloud Run"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/deployment-output.png')}
    />

    <img
        alt="Bakery application displaying a list of cakes"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/cakes-application.png')}
    />

Great job! You have just deployed a web application to a serverless cloud service!
