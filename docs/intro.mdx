MongoDB Atlas is the best way to deploy, manage, and grow MongoDB on Google Cloud! Today, we will be building an application hosted on Google Cloud Run that will display a list of cakes, with the ability to view further details on the cakes and even leave a comment! We will then learn to leverage Atlas App Services products such as Triggers and Functions, to call out to Google Cloud’s Natural Language Processing and carry out sentiment analysis on the comments.

Even better, no prior knowledge of MongoDB or Google Cloud is required!

## Agenda

1. [MongoDB Atlas: Cloud Database Setup](/docs/category/mongodb-atlas-cloud-database) - Get up and running in MongoDB Atlas by creating your first MongoDB Atlas database and inserting our first ever documents.
